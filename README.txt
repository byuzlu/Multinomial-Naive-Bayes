Remarks: 
1- One need to adjust the dataset import initially. Now, it is imported from my google drive
therefore curent document path may notwork for everyone. Please consider this before using.
2- The training datasets are feed to models automatically, therefore to use functions for different training datasets
one should change the functions accordingly.

Other than these, since this projected is implemented on Google Colab,
there is no additional default value or terminal command
that need to be entered. One can simply run this .ipynb
file on their Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
